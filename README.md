# ComposeWeatherApp
This app fetches user location and uses the Open Meteo API to get weather data and nicely display it in an Android app. The app shows the current time, current temperature, current weather description, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and forecast for the remaining hours of the day.
The app uses Clean Architecture, Compose UI, MVVM, and Dagger Hilt. It also uses abstractions to make the code more reusable and maintainable.
